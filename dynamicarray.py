"""
Static Array: Items stored in continous memeory

Problem: Once we reach a point in memory where there is something else being stored there, the array can not be increased in size. (Reached capacity)
"""

"""
Dynamic Array

When the array reaches capacity a new array is created with a bigger capacity in memeory copying the data over

Problems: Wastes memory if space is not needed.
